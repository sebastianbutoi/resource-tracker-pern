# Resource Tracker App - PERN Stack

## What is it?

The Resource Tracker app is designed to help bootcampers track all of the School of Code course subject topics on a daily basis as they are covered. The app provides a space for each day of the course to add topic titles along with any notes, resources and useful links all in one place. There is also a filtering functionality to recall the stored information.

## The database

In order to keep the database as simple as possible, there are only two tables with a One-to-May relationship, where a day can have multiple notes but a specific note is related to a single day only.
